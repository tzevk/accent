# Support Ticket System Documentation

## Overview
A structured employee support ticket system with automatic routing to HR or Admin departments based on request category.

## Ticket Flow
```
New → Under Review → In Progress → Waiting for Employee → Resolved → Closed
```

### Status Definitions

1. **New** (🆕)
   - Initial status when a ticket is created
   - Visible to assigned department (HR/Admin)
   - Awaiting first review

2. **Under Review** (👀)
   - Department has acknowledged the ticket
   - Investigating the request
   - May request additional information

3. **In Progress** (⚡)
   - Actively working on the request
   - Changes being implemented
   - Employee will be updated on progress

4. **Waiting for Employee** (⏳)
   - Department needs information/action from employee
   - Employee must respond to proceed
   - Auto-moves back to "In Progress" when employee comments

5. **Resolved** (✅)
   - Request has been completed
   - Resolution notes provided
   - Employee can review and request reopening if needed

6. **Closed** (🔒)
   - Final status, ticket is archived
   - No further action
   - Historical record maintained

## Ticket Creation (Employee Side)

### Required Fields
- **Subject**: Brief summary of the request
- **Category**: Determines routing to HR or Admin
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the request
- **Priority**: Low, Medium, High, or Urgent

### Optional Fields

### Categories & Routing

#### HR Department
| Category | Icon | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Payroll | 💰 | Salary, deductions, tax issues |
| Leave | 🏖️ | Leave applications, balance queries |
| Policy | 📋 | Company policies, guidelines |
| Confidential Matters | 🔒 | Private HR matters (restricted) |

#### Admin Department
| Category | Icon | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Access Cards | 🪪 | ID cards, access permissions |
| Seating | 💺 | Desk allocation, workspace requests |
| Maintenance | 🔧 | Facility issues, repairs |
| General Request | 📝 | Other administrative requests |

## Routing Logic

Tickets are automatically routed when created:

```javascript
// HR Categories
['payroll', 'leave', 'policy', 'confidential'] → HR

// Admin Categories
['access_cards', 'seating', 'maintenance', 'general_request'] → Admin
```

**Routing is automatic and cannot be changed by the employee.**

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Color | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Low | Gray | Can wait, not blocking work |
| Medium | Blue | Normal priority |
| High | Orange | Needs attention soon |
| Urgent | Red | Critical, blocking work |

## User Experience

### Employee Flow
1. Employee creates ticket → selects category
2. System shows "Routed to [HR/Admin]" confirmation
3. Employee tracks progress in dashboard
4. Receives updates via comments
5. Can respond if status is "Waiting for Employee"
6. Sees resolution notes when completed

### Admin/HR Flow
1. New tickets appear in dashboard
2. Review and move to "Under Review"
3. Assign to team member if needed
4. Work on request → "In Progress"
5. If need info → "Waiting for Employee"
6. Complete work → "Resolved" (add notes)
7. Archive → "Closed"

## Best Practices

### For Employees
- Choose the correct category for faster routing
- Provide detailed descriptions
- Attach relevant documents
- Respond promptly when status is "Waiting for You"
- Review resolution notes before closing

### For Admin/HR
- Acknowledge tickets quickly (New → Under Review)
- Assign to appropriate team members
- Add regular updates via comments
- Use "Waiting for Employee" when blocked
- Always add resolution notes when resolving
- Close tickets only when confirmed complete

## Future Enhancements
