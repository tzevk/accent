/**
 * Company expenditure — the shared financial module behind the monthly
 * reconciliation, the direct-cost entry and recognition controls, and the
 * source drilldown.
 *
 * This is the module's public interface. Callers (report routes, the entry and
 * command routes, and later the export and allocation slices) use these
 * exports and nothing else:
 *
 *   reads
 *     fetchCompanyReconciliation({ month, projectId? })
 *       Company Incurred Cost for a month, split into Incurred Project Cost,
 *       Company Overhead, and Unallocated Cost per currency, plus the Project
 *       breakdown, evidence states, and the coverage notices that say what the
 *       total does and does not include.
 *     fetchCostDrilldown(query)
 *       The source records behind the figures, with identity, evidence, and
 *       the expense state they were counted from.
 *     fetchCostJournal(costUid)
 *       The append-only command history of one cost.
 *     fetchProjectBudgets(projectId)
 *       Every approved (and draft) Project cost budget with its amount,
 *       currency, scope, period, approval evidence, and version.
 *     fetchCostBudget(id) / fetchBudgetJournal(budgetUid)
 *       One cost budget and its append-only approval journal.
 *     SOURCE_COVERAGE
 *       Which cost sources feed this module and which are still outstanding.
 *
 *   writes (one path, versioned)
 *     recordCost(input, actor, { connection? })
 *     executeCommand({ id, command, expectedVersion, reason?, patch? }, actor)
 *     recordCostBudget(input, actor, { connection? })
 *     executeBudgetCommand(
 *       { id, command, expectedVersion, reason?, evidenceReference?, patch? },
 *       actor
 *     )
 *
 * Invariants the module guarantees to every caller:
 *  - confirmed cost is `recognition_state = 'recognized'` and nothing else;
 *  - a missing amount is NULL, never zero, and never silently recognized;
 *  - the Recognition Period comes from the received-work period, or the bill
 *    date as a disclosed fallback;
 *  - currencies are not added together without a supported conversion;
 *  - every accepted command increments `financial_version` and appends one
 *    journal row, so a repeated or stale command changes nothing;
 *  - an approved cost budget is compared with Incurred Project Cost only when
 *    Project, currency, scope, and period match, and a budget never enters a
 *    cost total — `budgets` is its own section of the reconciliation.
 *
 * Later slices extend this module: a source adapter per cost source feeds the
 * same `buildReconciliation`, `command`/`revision` controls hang off the same
 * version + journal pair, and the Excel export consumes
 * `fetchCompanyReconciliation` so the download cannot disagree with the screen.
 * Cost budgets carry their own versioned commands and journal beside the cost
 * ones: a later financial close reads the same approved budget the month was
 * compared with, and a superseded approval stays readable.
